# The reference corpus, and what a winner actually scores

Three sites that solved the same problem differently are worth more than any
description of what good looks like. This file is how to get those three, what
to take from them, and what the people handing out the awards are actually
grading.

Every number here was measured on **2026-09-14** by fetching the page or running
the command. Re-run anything that looks stale; the commands are printed.

## The three-reference workflow

Stage 2 of `references/pipeline.md`. Four commands, in this order.

```bash
W="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/webdesign.mjs"

node "$W" awards --pick object --n 3        # 1. name the register, get three
node "$W" awards --techniques               # 2. what the corpus can be asked for
node "$W" awards --technique "scrub"        # 3. or search by the problem
node "$W" study --awards "scrub" --n 3      # 4. render them, then open the PNGs
```

**`awards --pick <register>` does not return the three best.** It returns three
that disagree - different studio, different source, different technique - and
only falls back to a second pass if fewer than `n` survive that filter. Studying
three variations of one look teaches the look. Studying three different answers
teaches the decision. The registers are fixed in `awards.mjs`:

| `--pick` | resolves to kind | use it when the brief is |
|---|---|---|
| `object` | `3d,product` | a physical thing you can turn |
| `product` | `product,3d` | software with a UI to show |
| `place` | `brand,editorial` | a location, a property, a venue |
| `service` | `portfolio`, filtered to rows mentioning "agency" | a practice selling judgement |
| `argument` | `editorial` | a thesis, a report, a manifesto |
| `portfolio` | `portfolio` | someone's own work |
| `3d` | `3d` | the technique is the brief |
| `editorial` | `editorial` | long-form type |
| `game` | `game` | something you play, in the browser |
| `app` | `app` | an installed or web application; see `apps.md` |
| `studio` | `studio,portfolio` | a studio's own site |

Anything else is treated as a free-text query and is not diversified by register.
Free text goes through the ordinary query path, where **every term must appear
somewhere in the row**, so one word works and two rarely do: `awards --pick
"watch"` returns three sites, `awards --pick "dive watch"` returns
`no matching reference sites`.

Real run, 2026-09-14, trimmed where marked `...` and transliterated to ASCII:

```

```

Three sources, three studios, no shared technique. The command ends by printing
the next command; that is the handoff.

Two things that run are visible in that output and are worth reading as warnings.
The Warhol row's `take` is an artist biography, not a craft move - a harvest
miss the schema cannot catch, because `why` is free prose. And `--pick` is the
only diversified path: `study --awards "scrub" --n 3` goes through the plain
query and today returns three Apple product pages, one publisher, one technique.
Diversity is a property of `--pick`, not of the corpus.

### The rest of the surface

```
awards [query]                      every term must appear somewhere; ranked by
                                    whether it hit the technique list or the prose
       --kind 3d|editorial|product|portfolio|ecommerce|brand|experiment
       --source awwwards|editorial|fwa|codrops|cssda|siteinspire|minimalgallery|
                httpster|lapaninja|webby|bwg|threejs   (run --stats for the live list)
       --award sotd|sotm|soty|honourable|showcase|developer
       --technique X --stack X      substring match inside those arrays
       --year N | --since YEAR      --verified
       --limit N (default 12)       --verbose adds type/palette/motion
       --json | --urls              --urls pipes straight into study
awards --pick <register> [--n 3] [--kind X] [--technique X] [--since YEAR]
awards --techniques                 the searchable index, with counts
awards --stats                      size, sources, kinds, awards, years
awards --build                      re-merge data/awards/*.json into awards.json
```

`--kind`, `--source` and `--award` take comma lists and match exactly. `--technique`
and `--stack` are substring matches against the arrays, which is what you want,
because the technique field is prose.

`study` renders whatever it is given:

```
study <url...>                                 your own URLs
study --list editorial|object|cinema|product   curated fallback, no corpus needed
study --awards "<query>" [--n 3] [--kind X] [--technique X]
      [--scroll 0,900] [--out DIR]
```

It captures each site at 1440 wide at every `--scroll` offset, then tiles them
with ffmpeg at 640px per tile, `4x2` per sheet, into `sheet<N>.jpg`. Eight
renders become one picture. Without ffmpeg on PATH the PNGs are the result and
it says so. Real run:

```
$ node scripts/webdesign.mjs study --awards "editorial grid" --n 1 --scroll 0,900 --out <scratch>/study-check
  ref   Studio K95 - shipping four proprietary typefaces for one portfolio site,
        instead of one hero animation, is the actual craft flex worth studying here
  ok    https://k95.it/en/studio

webdesign study  1 site(s), 2 render(s) -> <scratch>\study-check
  Read these, left to right, top to bottom:
  <scratch>\study-check\sheet1.jpg
    s01/w1440.png  s01/w1440-y900.png
```

`look` is the other renderer and is not interchangeable. `study` is for many
sites you did not build; `look` is for one page you did, and it returns a report
as well as pictures - overlap, overflow, contrast, at `--widths 1440,390` and
`--scroll 0,600` by default, `--no-shot` to skip the PNGs. It exits 1 on errors
and 2 if there is no browser installed. Point `look` at a directory and it
serves it first; point it at a URL and it just loads it.

### The `wall` verdict does not mean what it says

`study` calls a site a wall and drops it from the sheet when any capture has
fewer than 12 text elements (`webdesign.mjs`, in `cmdStudy`). It waits a
hardcoded **4200 ms** before capturing and exposes no `--wait` flag. The message
it prints - "blocked, or a JS-only page" - is a guess, and on the case measured
here both halves of the guess are wrong. Reproduced:

```
$ node scripts/webdesign.mjs study https://www.gionatannese.com/ --scroll 0
  wall  https://www.gionatannese.com/  (almost no text rendered - blocked, or a JS-only page)
ultimate-frontend-skills: nothing rendered      (exit 1)

$ curl -sA "<browser UA>" https://www.gionatannese.com/ | <strip script/style, strip tags>
HTTP 200  plain text chars: 1565
Gionatan Nese - Multi-Disciplinary Designer ... Projects 2 About 3 ...
```

Waiting longer does not fix it. `textElements` measured through `inspect()` at
1440 wide, same page, on 2026-09-14:

```
4200 ms  9      12000 ms  5      30000 ms  5
8000 ms  9      20000 ms  5                    (30000 is inspect's hard ceiling)
```

The count **falls** as the entrance animation runs. Probing the live DOM at
12 s explains why: 29 elements carry their own text and `document.body.innerText`
is 1,500 characters, but the probe drops 20 of them for measuring under 2px in
either axis and 4 more for sitting under a `fixed` or `sticky` ancestor, leaving
5. The same run reports `ERROR collapsed to zero size but has text:
div.absolute.bottom-5 "View Case"`, and the screenshot is a near-blank page.

So this is not a preloader and it is not a bot wall. It is **content invisible at
rest** - the from-state of a reveal authored in CSS and never animated out under
a headless capture - which `references/tells.md` already calls the most
consequential code-level tell. `debug --wait 12000` does **not** rescue it; it
renders the same near-blank page and exits 0, which is worse, because it looks
like success.

When you get `wall`, read it as "this page has almost no text a layout probe can
see" and nothing more. Check it by hand. A real bot wall renders fast and renders
a challenge page; a site like this one renders slowly and renders nothing.

That failure is also a finding in its own right. See the dated section.

### What a row holds

`data/awards.json` is an array of objects. Do not write it by hand - it is
harvested in chunks under `data/awards/` and merged by `awards --build`.

| field | type | what it is for |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | slug from `id`, else name, else URL; lowercased, max 60 chars |
| `name` | string | the site; falls back to `id` |
| `url` | string | must look like a URL or the row is dropped, not repaired |
| `studio` | string or null | used to stop `--pick` returning one studio twice |
| `year` | number | 0 unless it parses and lands strictly between 2000 and 2100 |
| `award` | string | lowercased, **not validated**; defaults to `reference` |
| `source` | string | lowercased, **not validated**; defaults to `editorial` |
| `kind` | string | one of the ten kinds (`3d`, `editorial`, `product`, `portfolio`, `ecommerce`, `brand`, `experiment`, `game`, `app`, `studio`); anything else becomes `editorial` |
| `stack` | string[] | libraries, as named by the source; provenance notes stripped |
| `techniques` | string[] | **sentences**, not tags - the mechanism is the point |
| `palette` | string | prose, with hexes where the source gave them |
| `type` | string | the typographic decision, in prose |
| `motion` | string | what moves and what drives it |
| `why` | string | the one transferable move. This is the payload |
| `verified` | boolean | strictly `row.verified === true`; a harvest convention, not a check the code performs |
| `aiGenerated` | boolean, optional | whether an agent built the site; kept only when the harvester recorded it, shown as `agent-built` in the listing |

`kind` is the only enumerated field. `award` and `source` are whatever the
harvester wrote, lowercased - which is why `--stats` is the only honest list of
what is in either. Today `award` holds `sotd`, `sotm`, `soty`, `honourable`,
`showcase`, `developer`, `fwa` and `reference`; `source` holds twelve values, not
the five the harvest started with. `palette`, `type`, `motion` and `why` are run
through a whitespace collapse, so a multi-line note arrives as one line.

`why` is the model of what a good extraction reads like - a mechanism and a
reason, never "clean modern layout":

> "letting book-cover photography do all the color work, instead of adding a
> brand palette on top, keeps a subscription-box site from looking like every
> other DTC template"

Two consequences of the schema worth knowing before you search.

**`techniques` is free prose, so all but a handful of strings are unique.**
Measured on 2026-09-14: 860 technique strings across 388 entries, 818 of them
distinct - the 42 repeats are short generic ones like `webgl`, not sentences.
Searching for an exact technique string is therefore useless. Substring search is
the only way in, and `awards --techniques` is the index to read first: it counts
a fixed vocabulary of build-out-of-it terms against the prose, so it tells you
what the corpus can be asked for rather than what it happens to say. It returned
52 terms today, led by `three.js 86`, `webgl 84`, `carousel 42`, `gsap 41`.

**`--build` is deterministic and destructive in one direction.** It merges every
`*.json` under `data/awards/` in sorted filename order, keys on URL, keeps the
richer record when two harvesters found the same site, and writes the whole file.
A chunk that is missing from the directory is simply absent from the rebuild.

```
$ node scripts/webdesign.mjs awards --build
{ "files": 12, "read": 12, "entries": 388, "duplicates": 17, "dropped": [] }
```

**Never hand-edit `awards.json`.** `--build` reads only the chunks, so any change
made to the merged file alone is reverted the next time anyone rebuilds, with no
warning and no entry in `dropped`. It is silent because the entry count does not
move: on 2026-09-14 the chunks carried 343 verified rows and the shipped
`awards.json` carried 336, same 388 entries either way. Correct a row in its
chunk and rebuild; that is the only edit that survives.

Run `awards --stats` for live counts rather than trusting any number written down
here; on 2026-09-14 it read **388 entries, 336 verified**, across twelve sources
- `awwwards 122 / editorial 114 / fwa 39 / codrops 37 / cssda 18 / siteinspire 14
/ minimalgallery 14 / httpster 14 / lapaninja 10 / webby 3 / bwg 2 / threejs 1` -
and awards `sotd 94 / showcase 85 / reference 76 / honourable 52 / developer 49 /
sotm 25 / soty 6 / fwa 1`.

### The method

1. Name the register, not the look. `awards --pick <register> --n 3`.
2. If the brief names a technique instead, search the problem:
   `awards --technique "scrub"`, `awards --kind product --stack three.js --verbose`.
3. Render all three. **Open the PNGs.** Reading the rows is not stage 2.
4. Write one line per reference: the move you are taking, and the move you are
   deliberately not taking.
5. Build. Then `verify <dir>` - audit, render, quality and security in one verdict.

Never copy a site. Three references that disagree is the point; three that agree
is a moodboard, and a moodboard is how you get the tell.

## The sources

Status column is the HTTP code returned for that exact URL as of 2026-09-14,
from curl with a browser user agent and **without** following redirects.

| Source | Status | Machine-readable index | What it is actually good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `awwwards.com` | 200 | none; `robots.txt` disallows `/feed` | The scored corpus. Only SOTD/SOTM/SOTY detail pages publish numbers |
| `tympanus.net/codrops/webzibition/` | 200 | none | **2,378 hand-picked sites** (its own printed count, which climbs daily), each linking straight to the live site. The best harvest target here: no detail-page hop, no bot wall, curation that matches this skill's technique class |
| `tympanus.net/codrops/` | 200 | `/feed/` and `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` | Where the technique is explained before it reaches an award page |
| `threejs.org/examples/files.json` | 200 | **yes - a real index, 607 entries** | Runnable technique, versioned, free. Not usually called a showcase; it is the most useful one on this list |
| `threejs.org` (the homepage grid) | 200 | the homepage HTML itself: 400 `<a href>` links, newest first, each with a `files/projects/<id>.jpg` thumbnail | The library's own showcase of submitted projects. The thumbnail id is the @threejs post that featured it and decodes to a date (`(id >> 22) + 1288834974657` ms); `cdn.syndication.twimg.com/tweet-result?id=<id>&token=4` returns that post without a login, and its video links to the author's own post - the primary source for who made it and in what words. Harvested 2026-09-22 into `chunk-13-threejs.json` |
| `webdesignawards.io` | 308 to `www.`, then 200 | none | The only platform found that publishes criterion **weights** rewarding what Awwwards underweights. They are on `/judging-rubric`, not the home page (see below) |
| `cssdesignawards.com` | 200 to curl | none | Per-judge score breakdowns, which Awwwards does not publish. Winner pages route on the trailing numeric id and ignore the slug |
| `winners.webbyawards.com` | 200 | none; listing is JS-rendered | Criteria definitions, not a harvest target |
| `onepagelove.com` | 200 | `/feed` RSS, live | Single-page structure. Taxonomies: genre, style, section, tech, platform |
| `minimal.gallery` | 200 | `/feed/` and `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` | Restraint as a register, with tool and platform tags |
| `lapa.ninja` | 301 to `www.`, then 200 | `/rss.xml` on the `www.` host | Landing pages, filterable by colour and year |
| `httpster.net` | 200 | no feed (`/feed/` 404s) | Faceted counts off its own nav - the best free read on what a large catalogue actually contains |
| `recent.design` | 200 | none | Where `godly.website` now redirects. A general design feed - branding, print, packaging - not just web |
| `siiimple.com`, `csswinner.com` | 200 | none | Volume. One line each |
| `mobbin.com`, `refero.design` | 200 | none | Product-UI reference, not web craft. Different job |
| `siteinspire.com` | **429** to curl | none | Rate-limited hard. Taxonomies are Styles, Types, Subjects, Platforms |
| `land-book.com` | **403** to everything tried | none | Not harvestable. Anything claimed about its structure is unverified |
| `thefwa.com` | 200, `/sitemap.xml` **500** | none | Client-rendered SPA; every href in source is an asset. Award tiers and criteria could not be confirmed |
| `bestwebsite.gallery` | 200, feed rebuilds daily | `/feed` RSS | **Dead.** Newest item is dated 18 November 2024. The feed's freshness is a lie the channel tells, not the items |

Awwwards URL shapes, every one confirmed 200 on 2026-09-14. Retry before you
believe a failure: `/websites/typography/` returned 502 on one pass and 200 on
the next two, from the same client, seconds apart.

```
/websites/sites_of_the_day/     /websites/sites_of_the_month/
/websites/sites_of_the_year/    /websites/honorable/
/websites/nominees/             /websites/developer/
/websites/<tag>/                three-js, webgl, react, webflow, framer, gsap,
                                next-js, nuxt-js, vue-js, astro, svelte, parallax,
                                animation, typography, 3d, sound-audio, scrolling
/sites/<slug>                   the detail page, where the scores are
?page=N                         pagination on any listing
```

**Check the `<title>`, not the status code.** `/websites/webgpu/` returns 200 and
renders `<title>Awwwards Nominees</title>` - a soft 404. There is no WebGPU tag
on Awwwards as of September 2026. `/websites/three-js/` returns its own title,
so the pattern itself is fine.

Honourable Mention and Nominee detail pages publish **no score at all**. The
phrase "the gap between an HM and a SOTD" is not a published quantity anywhere.

### Studios

Some of the corpus is harvested from studios directly rather than from an
award listing: `source: "studio"`, `kind: "studio"`, one row for the studio's
own site and one per case page that could be fetched, with the live work URL
in `why`. Added 2026-09-20:

**Shader** (`data/awards/chunk-12-shader.json`, 12 rows) - a creative
development studio in Norrkoping, Sweden, doing interactive 3D and AI for the
web. Its own site, `shader.se`, was Awwwards Site of the Day on 20 April 2026
(7.73; DEV 8.12, Animations 9.40), credited to Shader and Andreas Antonsson.
The whole site is one canvas element with a hidden DOM and ARIA layer behind
it, per its own accessibility statement; the bundle carries both
`WebGPURenderer` and `WebGLRenderer`, React Three Fiber, Lenis, Draco, KTX2 and
Meshopt, Mux video and one self-hosted serif (STIX Two Text). Rendered here it
showed its loader at both widths and in both motion modes: a CRT boot screen in
a single blue, a serif italic wordmark, "Version 1.02", a segmented progress
bar and a copyright line - real 3D authored for the subject, one colour, no
cards, copy that names Blender, React Three Fiber, 8th Wall and "we don't
troubleshoot printers". Everything past the loader is read from the served HTML
and bundle rather than seen. The eleven case pages (port logistics in 3D, a
glass configurator priced from an API, a 3D interior planner with over a
hundred products, an AR grocery game on 8th Wall, an AI retirement-video
generator, and the plain ticketing site the studio shows beside them) were all
fetched and answered; their live work URLs answered 200 the same day and were
not rendered. Founders and founding year are UNVERIFIED here.

## The technique taxonomy

The centre of this file. Cost is gzipped transfer, measured on 2026-09-14 by
fetching the exact CDN build and gzipping it in-process - not an estimate, and
not the raw size vendors quote.

| Technique | How it is actually built | Library | Cost (gz) | Right when | A costume when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Editorial grid with breakout lines** | CSS Grid with named lines; one element deliberately spans past the text column; hairlines derived from the ink colour, not from black | none | **0** | Always. This is what separates the top scorers from the bottom of the same listing | Never. The cheapest real craft on the list, and the one nobody ships instead of a shader |
| **WebGL fluid / mesh gradient** | one full-screen triangle, one fragment shader, 3-4 simplex-noise octaves against time. No scene graph, no camera | `gradient.js` (ships here) or ogl | **0 - 39 KB** | The brand has no photography and the page needs a ground that is not flat | It sits behind text where nobody will look. A CSS `radial-gradient` reads identically at 0 KB |
| **Scroll-scrubbed 3D** | GSAP timeline driven by ScrollTrigger, `scrub: 0.8`, `pin: true`, `anticipatePin: 1`; camera or model transform on `ease: 'none'` | GSAP + ScrollTrigger + three.js | **46 + 191 KB** | The subject *is* an object and rotating it reveals something a photograph cannot | The model is a generic abstract blob. Then it is a gradient with extra steps at 237 KB |
| **Image-sequence scroll** | 60-180 pre-rendered frames, `drawImage` into a canvas against scroll progress, every frame preloaded before the section is reachable | GSAP ScrollTrigger + bare canvas | **18 KB + the frames** | The motion is real footage, or a Blender bake you cannot ship as geometry | You need 120 frames to sell a fade. Budget the frames before you commit; they dominate the page weight, always |
| **Pinned horizontal section** | `pin: true` on a sticky wrapper, `x: -(track.scrollWidth - innerWidth)` tweened against scroll distance | GSAP ScrollTrigger | **46 KB** | The content is genuinely a sequence - a timeline, a process, a filmstrip | Applied to a feature grid. Horizontal scroll destroys scanning, and there was no sequence to follow |
| **Text mask reveal** | split to lines, wrap each in `overflow: clip`, `yPercent: 110 -> 0`, stagger ~0.06, inside `document.fonts.ready` | GSAP SplitText | **28 + 4 KB** | The headline is the one dominant element on that screen | On every heading. It is also the single most common cause of content invisible at rest, when the from-state is authored in CSS instead of by JS |
| **Layout transition (card becomes page)** | measure first, mutate the DOM, `Flip.from(state)` animates the difference | GSAP Flip | **28 + 9 KB** | The card and the page genuinely show the same object | Two unrelated panels crossfading. Flip's whole value is that the element is continuous |
| **Cursor distortion** | an ogl or three plane sampling an image with a UV offset driven by a lagged pointer vector | ogl or curtainsjs | **26 - 39 KB** | It is a portfolio, and touch users get a real fallback rather than a still | Desktop-only decoration on a product page. Roughly half the traffic sees nothing and pays nothing back |
| **Custom cursor** | a fixed div lerped toward the pointer, `mix-blend-mode: difference`, scaled on hover targets | none | **~0** | The site's whole register is a gallery | It lags the native cursor by even 60 ms, or it hides the real one anywhere near a form field |
| **Physics layout** | matter-js bodies, a `Mouse` constraint, DOM nodes positioned from body transforms each tick | matter-js | **25 KB** | The metaphor is literally accumulation, collapse or weight | Letters bounce for no reason. It also destroys tab order unless a real DOM list survives underneath |
| **Marquee type** | duplicate the track, `translateX(-50%)` on a linear infinite keyframe; or couple the skew to scroll velocity | CSS, or GSAP for the velocity coupling | **0 - 46 KB** | One, as a divider, as a rule | Three of them. It is the cheapest motion on the page and it reads as exactly that |
| **Same-document view transition** | `document.startViewTransition()` around the state change, `view-transition-name` on the shared element | native | **0 KB** | Any tab swap, filter or route change inside one page. **90.2% support: Chrome 111+, Firefox 144+, Safari 18.0+** | You shipped a library to crossfade two DOM states |
| **Cross-document view transition** | `@view-transition { navigation: auto }` in both documents, matched `view-transition-name` | native | **0 KB** | A multi-page static site, as progressive enhancement. **84.5% full support: Chrome 126+, Safari 18.2+. Firefox 144+ is partial - Level 1 only** | You treat it as universal. Firefox may get a plain navigation - which is fine, and is the reason to use it rather than ship JS |
| **JS page transition** | intercept the link, fetch the next document, swap containers, keep a persistent canvas alive across the swap | `@unseenco/taxi` 1.9.1, or `@barba/core` | **10 KB** | You must keep WebGL state or an audio graph alive across a navigation. That is the only remaining reason | A crossfade on every link. That is a 400 ms delay with a library attached, and the platform now does the visual part for free |
| **Scroll inertia (smooth scroll)** | a rAF loop that intercepts wheel and lerps `scrollTop`; must be wired into `ScrollTrigger.update` or every pin drifts | lenis 1.3.26 | **5 KB** | A deliberate brand decision, on a site with almost no forms | On by default. It breaks `scroll-behavior: smooth`, anchor jumps, find-in-page scroll position, and every native scrollbar affordance at once |

### What 45 current Awwwards winners are actually built with

Tag counts from the `Technologies & Tools` block on the 45 most recent Sites of
the Day, scraped 2026-09-14. Out of 45: **GSAP 26, 3D 23, WebGL 20, Animation 19,
Storytelling 15, Three.js 14, Typography 11.** The only framework or builder tags
anywhere near the top are Webflow 9 and Next.js 7. React, Vue, Nuxt, Astro and
Svelte all sit below 5 of 45.

**The winning stack is one animation library plus one renderer.** Not a
framework. GSAP is on 58% of them, and reaching for it is what the field does -
`references/stack.md` is right that hand-rolling a scroll engine to avoid it
produces the low-effort version.

### Three corrections to `references/stack.md`

Measured by fetching each build and gzipping it, 2026-09-14. All three of that
file's estimates are wrong in the cheap direction - the page costs more than it
says:

| Build | stack.md says | measured gz |
|---|---|---|
| `three@0.186.0/build/three.module.min.js` + `three.core.js` | ~160 KB gz | **370 KB** |
| `pixi.js@8.20.1/dist/pixi.min.mjs` | ~120 KB gz | **226 KB** |
| `postprocessing@6.39.5/build/index.js` | ~40 KB gz | **154 KB** |

Gzipping `three.module.min.js` on its own gives 88 KB, and an earlier pass of
this file printed that. It is not the page cost: the entry module's first line
imports `./three.core.js`, which is 281 KB gz and is not minified on any CDN.
`three.md` §2 has the import-map entry that swaps in the minified core and
brings the pair to 191 KB.

Also: the `+esm` specifiers stack.md prints are dependency-inlined bundles, and
that is what you pay. `animejs@4.5.0/+esm` is **42 KB gz**, not ~10.
`ogl@1.0.11/+esm` is **39 KB gz**, not ~10.

The rest of the measured table, for budgeting:

```
gsap 3.15.0 core          28 KB     lenis 1.3.26              5 KB
  + ScrollTrigger         18 KB     locomotive-scroll 5.0.1   9 KB
  + SplitText              4 KB     matter-js 0.20.0         25 KB
  + Flip                   9 KB     lottie-web 5.13.0        75 KB
three 0.186.0 WebGL      191 KB     @rive-app/canvas 2.42.1  98 KB
three 0.186.0 WebGPU     304 KB     troika-three-text 0.52.5 56 KB
postprocessing 6.39.5    154 KB     curtainsjs 8.1.6         26 KB
pixi.js 8.20.1           226 KB     @barba/core 2.10.3       10 KB
animejs 4.5.0 (+esm)      42 KB     embla-carousel 8.6.0      7 KB
ogl 1.0.11 (+esm)         39 KB     split-type 0.3.4         12 KB
```

Both three.js rows are **entry module plus its core, with the core remapped to
`three.core.min.js`** - the pair the page actually downloads, per `three.md`.
Left as published they are 370 and 482 KB. Every other row is a single file:
GSAP from cdnjs, the rest from `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/`. `curtainsjs` is
`dist/curtains.umd.min.js`. `split-type` publishes no minified build at all, so
12 KB is what the bare specifier costs; its `+esm` is 5 KB.

**The WebGPU build costs 304 KB gz against 191 for WebGL - 1.6x, and 113 KB in
absolute terms.** (Entry modules alone it looks like 201 against 88, a far more
dramatic 2.3x; that comparison is wrong, because both builds import the same
`three.core.js` and the shared core cancels.) It is still the single most
important cost fact of 2026, because everything fashionable is pushing toward
it. See the dated section for when the 113 KB is worth paying.

## What jurors actually score

Awwwards prints its evaluation system on every winner's detail page:

```
Design 40%   Usability 30%   Creativity 20%   Content 10%
```

It is a literal weighted mean, not a vibe. Re-checked on 2026-09-14 against 20
of the recent Sites of the Day: **the 40/30/20/10 weights reproduce the
published overall from the published sub-scores to within 0.01 on every row, and
exactly on 16 of 20.** White Desert: 7.28 / 7.27 / 7.21 / 7.74, weighted 7.309,
published **7.31**. The four that land 0.01 low - Tuscan Journey, Why Zero,
Trevor Noah, AI in Design Report - are rounding, not a different formula:
Awwwards rounds each sub-score to two places before printing it, so recomputing
from the printed values loses the last digit. Do not read a 0.01 gap as a
hidden fifth criterion.

There is a second, separate award with its own six criteria - the **DEV AWARD**:
Semantics / SEO, Animations / Transitions, Accessibility, WPO, Responsive Design,
Markup / Meta-data.

### The measured distribution

Scraped 2026-09-14 by walking the Sites of the Day listing and opening every
winner. n = 45.

```
SOTD overall       n=45   min 7.17   mean 7.36   max 7.73

  Design 40%       n=45   min 7.10   mean 7.40   max 7.81
  Usability 30%    n=45   min 6.90   mean 7.19   max 7.48
  Creativity 20%   n=45   min 7.10   mean 7.54   max 8.16
  Content 10%      n=45   min 6.98   mean 7.38   max 7.90

DEV AWARD overall  n=41   min 7.07   mean 7.42   max 7.93
  Accessibility    n=41   min 6.20   mean 6.80   max 7.60
  Animations       n=41   min 7.20   mean 7.96   max 9.20

which dimension was the winner's own weakest:
  Usability 32    Design 6    Content 4    Creativity 3
```

The DEV AWARD sub-scores live inside the same block as the DEV overall, so they
are necessarily the same n: four of the 45 carry no dev award at all. An
independent re-scrape of 20 of these winners reproduced every band - overall
7.20/7.40/7.73, usability 7.00/7.21/7.46, creativity 7.10/7.57/8.16,
accessibility 6.40/6.88/7.60, animations 7.20/7.87/8.40, and usability weakest
on 14 of 20.

Four things fall out of this, and they are the most useful facts in the file.

**1. A day winner is a 7.36, and the band is 0.56 wide.** All 45 sit between
7.17 and 7.73; an independent re-scrape of 20 of them on the same day landed
7.20 to 7.73, mean 7.40. You are not chasing an 8.5 - on this platform an 8.5
does not happen. The ceiling belongs to the sites that go on to win at year
tier, and their **SOTD** pages read 7.92 (Igloo Inc) and 8.18 (Lando Norris) -
so a site scoring above this band on an ordinary day is the signal, not a
separate year-tier scale. **7.4 wins a day. Roughly 7.9 to 8.2 is what a
year-winner scored on its day.**

**2. Usability is the lowest of the four on 32 of 45 winners, and it carries
30%.** It is the ceiling on the entire platform. Moving usability from 7.0 to 8.0
adds 0.30 to the overall. The same move on creativity adds 0.20; on content, 0.10.
The cheapest point available to a cinematic page is the one every cinematic page
throws away.

**3. Creativity is the only dimension with real spread, and it is what separates
a day from a year.** Range 7.10-8.16 across day winners; the year-tier sites sit
at 8.31 and 8.71. Design barely moves at all (7.10-7.81). Design gets you
admitted. Creativity gets you remembered. Usability decides whether you clear
the bar.

**4. On the dev award, accessibility is the floor: mean 6.80, and across the 41
winners carrying a dev award it never once exceeded 7.60.** Animations is the ceiling: mean 7.96, max
9.20. These pages are graded at about 8.0 on motion and 6.8 on access. A page
that keeps the motion *and* fixes the accessibility outscores all 41 of them on
the dev criteria. That is an unguarded gap, not a trade-off.

### The honest gap between a good page and a winning one

On the same White Desert page, on the same day, the jury scored 7.31 and the
community aggregate row scored **9.31** - 9.4 / 9.3 / 9.4 / 8.8. A two-point gap
on one site.

Anything optimised for the screenshot scores 9.3. The jury scores 7.3. The
difference is everything a screenshot cannot show: whether the thing is usable,
whether it loads, whether the keyboard works, whether the content is worth the
scroll. **Building for the 9.3 is how you ship a page that looks like a winner
and is not one.**

### The other rubrics, for contrast

**webdesignawards.io** publishes weights, and they price what Awwwards does not:

| criterion | weight |
|---|---|
| Performance & Technical Implementation | 20% |
| Innovation & Future Readiness | 20% |
| User Experience & Strategy | 15% |
| Visual Design & Branding | 15% |
| Content & Storytelling | 10% |
| Accessibility & Inclusivity | 10% |
| Responsiveness & Multi-device Support | 10% |

Visual design is 15% there against 40% on Awwwards. Accessibility is a named
10% line that Awwwards folds into a separate optional award.

**CSS Design Awards** runs a different scale entirely, and this is the scale that
"6.5 versus 8.5" actually describes. From its FAQ, quoted exactly: CSSDA uses two
judging systems, the first for Website of the Day and "determined by the scores
from the judging panel", where "sites must receive an average score above 8.0
(this varies depending on quality of the sites submitted)"; "Sites, except WOTDs,
that receive above 6 receive **Special Kudos**". The parenthetical matters - the
8.0 is a guideline, not a gate. Verified on a real winner,
`cssdesignawards.com/sites/won-j-you-studios/48029`: WOTD 14 Sept 2025, Final
Judge's Score **8.24**, six individual judges published (8.37, 8.27, 8.13, 8.07,
8.07, 8.00) and a separate public vote (UI 8.35 / UX 8.19 / Innovation 8.18, 20
votes each).

Do not carry an Awwwards number onto a CSSDA page or the reverse. A 7.4 wins on
one and fails the threshold on the other.

**Webby** publishes seven criteria for websites - Content, Structure and
Navigation, Visual Design, Functionality, Interactivity, Innovation, Overall
Experience - and **no weights at all**. What it prices that neither of the others
does is repeat visits and content depth: Overall Experience is defined by whether
people come back, bookmark, sign up and recommend.

## What now reads as dated

`references/tells.md` owns the general catalogue: the cream-and-serif reflex, the
italic accent word at more than one per page, indigo CTAs, the section waterfall,
invented specifics, `transition: all`, content invisible at rest. All of it still
holds and none of it is restated here. This section is only what the 2026
measurements added.

**Dated, with the evidence:**

- **Godly as a source.** `godly.website` returns `301 -> http://recent.design/?ref=godly`.
  Any doc still saying "Godly, for landing pages" is describing a site that no
  longer exists in that form, and recent.design is a general design feed with
  branding, print and packaging in the nav.
- **Best Website Gallery as a current source.** The feed rebuilds daily; the
  newest item in it is dated 18 November 2024.
- **Barba or Taxi as the default page-transition answer.** Same-document view
  transitions are at 90.2% support across all three engines. Shipping 10 KB of
  JS to crossfade two pages is the tell now, not the technique. Keep the library
  only for persisting a canvas or an audio graph across a navigation.
- **Locomotive Scroll as the smooth-scroll default.** v5.0.1, last published
  2026-01-15. lenis shipped 1.3.26 on 2026-08-05, at 5 KB gz against 9.
- **split-type alongside GSAP.** Last release 2023-10-22. SplitText has been free
  since April 2025 and is 4 KB gz. Loading both is dead weight.
- **hover-effect (2023-02-15) and zdog (2022-01-22).** Frozen. Fine to use;
  not fine to present as current.
- **Brutalism as a live movement.** Httpster's own facet counts, read off its
  nav: Photographic 1412, Typographic 1193, Minimal 847, Dark 259, **Brutalist 5**.
  Five, in a catalogue of thousands. Whatever the discourse says, it is a
  rounding error in the corpus.
- **"The Awwwards look" as a goal.** The community scores that look 9.31 and the
  jury scores the same site 7.31.

**Newly a tell, specific to 2026:**

- **The entrance animation that never finishes.** Measured on one SOTD-winning
  portfolio: the server returns a complete 1,565-character page to curl, the DOM
  at 12 seconds holds 1,500 characters of text across 29 elements, and 20 of
  those elements are still collapsed to under 2px because their reveal never
  ran. A headless capture sees a blank page at 4.2 s and at 30 s alike. This is
  `tells.md`'s "content invisible at rest" caught in the wild on an awarded
  site, and it costs usability - the dimension that already caps 32 of 45
  winners. Author the from-state in JS, after `document.fonts.ready`, so the
  markup is readable when the JS does not run.
- **The WebGPU build shipped for a WebGL effect.** The frontier is genuinely
  there: `threejs.org/examples/files.json` now indexes **230 WebGPU examples
  against 220 WebGL** (plus 48 `webgl / advanced`, 26 postprocessing, 4
  `webgl / tsl`; 607 total), and Codrops' recent run is largely WebGPU and TSL.
  But Awwwards has no WebGPU tag - `/websites/webgpu/` soft-404s to Nominees.
  The frontier and the award surface have not met. Paying 113 KB gz extra for a
  tag that does not exist is this year's costume. Pay it when you need compute
  shaders or a node material you cannot express in GLSL, and not for the name.
- **Accessibility treated as an acceptable loss.** Mean 6.80 across the 41
  winners that carry a dev award, ceiling 7.60. It reads as normal because everybody does it. It is the cheapest
  unclaimed score on the platform, and it is the one item on this list that is a
  defect rather than a fashion.
- **Pure-CSS scroll-driven animation as a shipping answer.** MDN flags
  `animation-timeline` as "Limited availability - does not work in some of the
  most widely-used browsers", and caniuse-db 1.0.30001810 carries no feature key
  for it at all, which is its own answer. Drive scroll work with ScrollTrigger
  and keep the CSS version as progressive enhancement.

**Not a tell, despite the reflex to call it one:** GSAP. It is on 58% of current
winners.

## The line to carry into the build

A day winner is a 7.36 and its weakest dimension is usability at 7.19. You are
not chasing an 8.5. You are chasing a 7.4 with the usability point that the other
forty-four gave away.
